# Restaurant Management System - Samrudhi 👨‍🍳

A comprehensive and `free to use` restaurant management system designed to streamline operations, enhance customer experience, and optimize resource management.

## Why? 🤔

Managing a restaurant involves juggling multiple tasks, from taking orders to creating bills and managing inventory. This project aims to simplify these tasks by providing an integrated solution that addresses common challenges faced by restaurant managers.

- As a `member of a family that recently started a restaurant`, I have firsthand experience with the challenges of managing daily operations.
- Tasks such as **taking orders, creating bills, managing inventory, and ensuring customer satisfaction** can be overwhelming.
- The Restaurant Management System - Samrudhi was developed to address these challenges.
- It aims to **streamline operations, reduce manual errors, and enhance the dining experience**, providing a practical solution to real-world problems faced by my family and other restaurant owners.

## Why Not Use an Existing Solution? ❓

- Existing solutions are **expensive** and **complex**, making them unsuitable for my needs.
- They do not offer the **customization** and **flexibility** required to meet the unique needs of my family's restaurant.

## Important Note ⚠️

> This project is intended to be free to use for any restaurant owner who wants to try restaurant management software but is deterred by the high costs of such simple CRUD applications.

> If you are a software developer, please use this software ethically and do not exploit new restaurant owners who are looking to digitalize their restaurant management. I personally come from the same background and understand the challenges they face.
